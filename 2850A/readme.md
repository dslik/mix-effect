# Source Meters Module

Four-channel program audio monitor for input sources.

Initial features include:
- Four source inputs
- Stereo PPM meters per input source
- Select/mute button for source audio control
- Channel gain adjust when used with 2850A
- Compatible with mixers and DAWs that support Mackie Control Universal over MIDI

The many small LEDs on the 2850-0301 LED board are difficult to reliably hand-assembly, so this board is best ordered pre-assembled from your PCB house. BOM and component placement files are provided for this board (2850-0301).

Full assembly instructions will be uploaded soon.
