## Project Overview
An open-hardware moduar control surface for vision mixers, such as OBS and ATEM.

Modules include:

* 2810A/2811A Source Selectors
* 2820A/2821A Transtion Controllers
* 2850A/2851A Source Meters
* 2860A Level Controller
* 2880A Touch Screen Controller
* 2890A Power Controller

All modules fit into a standard Eurorack chassis (but do not use Eurorack power), allowing you to create your own layouts with as many sources and M/E channels as needed. This also allows additional custom and use-specific modules are easily added.

## Project Goals
* Modular: Combine functional blocks that way you need and the way you want.
* Extensible: Easy to add new functionality and modules.
* Open source: Available for use and extension with minimal restrictions. See the [license](./license.md) for more details.
* Low-cost: Each module's BOM costs under $100, with some modules costing under $50.
